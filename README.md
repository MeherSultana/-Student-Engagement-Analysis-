# ğŸ“Š Student Engagement Analysis This notebook demonstrates how to analyze student engagement using attendance, assignment, and participation data.

ğŸ”¹ Load the Data:
Imported CSV files containing student attendance, assignment scores, and weekly participation logs using pandas.

ğŸ”¹ Clean and Prepare the Data:
Parsed dates, handled missing values, and added useful features like week numbers extracted from attendance dates.

ğŸ”¹ Analyze Weekly Attendance:
Grouped attendance records by student and ISO calendar week, then calculated each student's weekly attendance rate. Aggregated this further to find the average attendance trend across all students per week.

ğŸ”¹ Analyze Assignment Scores:
Grouped assignment scores by type (e.g., Homework, Quiz, Project) to compute average performance and highlight strengths or areas needing support.

ğŸ”¹ Analyze Participation Trends:
Averaged weekly posts_made and resources_viewed per student, and plotted trends over time to evaluate student engagement across weeks.

ğŸ”¹ Visualize the Data:
Used matplotlib to generate insightful plots showing:

Weekly attendance rates

Average assignment scores by type

Participation trends over time

ğŸ”¹ Save Plots for Documentation:
All plots were saved using plt.savefig() to the /images folder
